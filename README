This repository helps me to configure a fresh Git install on any computer.

* Propose to align Git with latest version (by adding PPA on demand)
* Install git global configuration
* Modify the prompt (PS1) to get the branch name and additional information from git
  - think about deactivating any older PS1 configuration
- Install aliases for `git` command `g`
- Install completion for git and gitflow
